Hi, I’m @feath3rz,

Welcome to my github. I have an interest in all things related to Cybersecurity and Information Security. But I also love a lot of random things as well! Overall I love learning. Learning and growing is what makes me the happiest!

Currently I'm learning the following:
 - TryHackMe - exploring many rooms and completed paths. It's a wonderful community
 - HackTheBox - I signed up many years ago but only came back as I've grown since then and would like to put my skills to the test
 - Reverse Engineering - This was my initial drive into Cybersecurity. During my journey I took a class that taught IDA and it was inspiring! I've used IDA and Ghidra and especially grew learning buffer overflows during the picoCTF and it's been one of the things I'd like to focus on.
 - Python - I've completed AdventofCode 2020 learning Python but I decided to start going through the book "Python Crash Course" https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e
 - Network+ - I know I've got a grasp on my certifications but I really want to get a large grasp on Networking so I am currently taking a course through Udemy to learn this more thoroughly.  Never can learn enough!

Currently I'm looking for a Cybersecurity job to get real world experience. Reverse Engineering is my passion but I am very open to also Penetration Testing or an Analyst position.  Wish me luck!

If you're here due to my resume, I'm sure you know how to reach me ;)  So far this is just for my notes and learning.  But should I start making formal tools, I'll put up ways to reach me.

Thank you! <3
